# Sprint 1

## User Stories

1. As an international student, I want to search for off-campus housing with specific filters so that I can find an apartment that meets my preferences without visiting in person.
2. As a user, I want to see detailed information about an apartment, including ratings, reviews, and amenities, to make an informed decision.
3. As a user, I want to see apartment ratings and reviews from other students so that I can make an informed decision.
4. As a user, I want a login page to create and manage my account.
5. As a user, I want to filter apartments based on various criteria such as cleanliness, proximity to campus, and availability of nearby amenities.
6. As a user, I want a roommate matching feature based on my preferences so that I can find a compatible roommate in my desired apartment.
7. As a user, I want a chatbot which makes it easier to communicate with the website to find my ideal home.

## Issues Planned to Address

1. Create a good layout and visually appealing website using React libraries and clean CSS.
2. Design and implement a stylish header containing the site name along with login and contact buttons.
3. Develop a functional login page for user authentication.
4. Implement a contact form to allow users to reach out for inquiries.
5. Create a search bar that enables users to search for apartments easily.
6. Develop apartment filters to refine search results based on user preferences.
7. Implement clickable apartment cards that generate a pop-up displaying user reviews, ratings, and apartment details.

## Successfully Completed Tasks

1. Designed and implemented the initial layout of the website using React and CSS.
2. Developed a stylish header with the site name and navigation buttons.
3. Created a functional login page with a basic authentication system.
4. Designed and implemented a contact form for user inquiries.
5. Added a working search bar that allows users to search for apartments.

## Issues Not Completed and Reasons

1. Apartment filters not implemented: We were focused on familiarizing ourselves with React and frontend development, delaying the implementation of apartment filters for sorting based on user preferences. This will be prioritized in the next sprint.
2. Apartment cards not fully functional: While apartment cards were developed with essential details like name, pincode, and rating, they are not yet clickable. The goal for the next sprint is to enable a pop-up displaying detailed information, including user reviews and ratings.

## Backlog for Next Sprint

1. Implement apartment filters to help users refine their search based on priorities such as proximity to campus, food stores, and other amenities.
2. Enable clickable apartment cards that display a pop-up with comprehensive details, user reviews, and ratings.
3. Begin integrating NLP techniques to generate apartment descriptions from user reviews.
4. Enhance the apartment details pop-up with maps, photo galleries, and additional relevant information.
