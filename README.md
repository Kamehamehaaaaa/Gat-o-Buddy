# UF NestMate

Makes it easier for international students for whom it’s harder to find a place to stay since they can’t come in person and search for apartments because it'll be too late by then.

# Description

A single-page web application for international students to find their ideal off-campus housing from their home country.

# Features

-   Add different filters for their preferences like cleanliness, close to campus, bigger international community, closer to amenities like food stores (Walmart, Trader Joe’s), closer to hospital, etc.

-   The housing apartments each have a rating based on reviews from users and a small description which can be created using NLP techniques by picking words from seniors/user reviews.

-   Can add a feature where after the apartment has been selected, a roommate matching feature can be done based on preferences like cleanliness, sleep schedule, eating habits, and interests.

-   Can add a feature to find a study buddy once the apartment has been selected, can allow them to create user profiles with academic interests, courses, and availability and matching them based on shared courses and study habits, and maybe a messaging system for coordination.

# User Stories

-   As an international student, I want to search for off-campus housing with specific filters so that I can find an apartment that meets my preferences without visiting in person.
